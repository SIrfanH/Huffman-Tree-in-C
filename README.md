This program creates and shows the first step of the Huffman lossless compression algorithm. Which is Creating the Huffman Tree.

Program Features:<br/>
  1. Store the characters and their occurence count in the string inside a linked list.<br/>
  2. Sort the nodes of the linked list according to the occurence of the characters using Insertion Sort.<br/>
  3. Create the Huffman Tree from the sorted linked list<br/>
  4. Print the Huffman Tree from the root to the leafs by printing nodes that are at the same level in the same row.<br/>
